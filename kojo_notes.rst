My notes from the video series on Flask
========================================

Follow-up points
-----------------
-  Jinja2 Macros

    +  In example 2e, he starts using macros (functions in Jinja2 templates). I need to play with these more to better internalize them

-  Twitter bootstrap

    +  Although not critical for Flask, I'm also using it with my blog and the Django Girls tutorial uses it. So, I need to be more familiar with it.
